## Single-page web app created with React to fetch and display data.

Based on robofriends, this simple app has been conceived as a contact list. It fetches user data from the API DummyJSON.com and displays them as cards. The cards have been styled using the package Tachyons and the images have been generated using RoboHash. I have included on click and on hover functions to show/hide the cards and display more information about the user.

The styling is not great for now, so I might change it in the future :)
