# monsterbook

This project was created using React and Tachyons.

## Idea

This was created to practice concepts learned in the Complete Web Developer course by Andrei Neagoie. 

### Functionality

It fetches user data from DummyJSON.com and displays them in cards.

### Lessons Learned

* How to build a React app from scratch.
* How to use the fetch method and display the response. How to use events like onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave/onClick, etc.

### Room for Improvement

Besides better styling, it could feature a searchbar, options to organize the contacts in different orders and add or delete them.
