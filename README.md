## Single-page web app created to practice using React to fetch and display data.

This simple app works as a contact list. It fetches user data from the API DummyJSON.com and displays them in cards. The cards have been styled using Tachyons and the images have been generated using RoboHash. I have included onClick and onHover functions to show/hide the cards and display more information about the user.

Version 2.0 will ahve better styling and more functionalities.
