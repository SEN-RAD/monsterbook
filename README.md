# monsterbook

## Single-page web app created with React to fetch and display data.

This contact list fetches user data from the API DummyJSON.com and displays them in cards. The cards have been styled using Tachyons and the images have been generated using RoboHash. I have included onClick and onMouseEnter/Leave functions to show/hide the cards and display more information about the user.
