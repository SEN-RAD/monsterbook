monsterbook
Single-page web app that fetches data from an API and displays it as cards.

Based on robofriends, this simple app has been conceived as a contact list. It uses the fetch() method to fetch fake user data from the API DummyJSON.com, displaying such data as cards, which have been styled using the package Tachyons. The monster images have been generated using RoboHash. I have included on click and on hover functions to show/hide the cards and display more information about the user.
